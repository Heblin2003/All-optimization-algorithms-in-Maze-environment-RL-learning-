# Reinforcment-Learning
Reinforcement learning projects:

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent's goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time by taking a series of actions. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled data but learns from trial and error.

It include hands-on implementation projects on optimisation algotithms on 5x5 grid maze environment where the agents learn optimized approaches to acheive the goals state. Some of the optimization methods used are:

Value iteration

policy iteration

on-policy mc control

on-policy with alpha

off-policy mc control

sarsa algorithm

n-step sarsa algorithm

q-learning algorithm


This is the outcome of the maze environment where the agent use random actions to reach the goal.
