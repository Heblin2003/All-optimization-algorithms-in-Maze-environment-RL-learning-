Reinforcement learning projects

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent's goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time by taking a series of actions. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled data but learns from trial and error.
